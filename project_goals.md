# LDP-V1: Project Goals

## Mission Statement
LDP-V1 is a specialized web-based lighting design platform developed to serve as a central hub for professional architectural lighting designers. Its primary purpose is to host a suite of design and documentation tools tailored specifically for the internal design team, providing a high-performance workspace for complex lighting workflows.

## Core Objectives
- **Process Automation**: Aim to eliminate repetitive, menial tasks that consume significant manual effort in the design cycle.
- **Speed & Efficiency**: Accelerate documentation and analysis phases, allowing designers to focus more on creative and technical excellence.
- **Modular Expansion**: The platform is built with a plugin-first mindset, intended to support the continuous addition of new tools and modules over time.
- **Professional Standards**: Ensure all tools meet the rigorous precision and visual standards required by the professional lighting design industry.

## Vision
While currently optimized for internal team use, LDP-V1 is designed with the scalability to eventually serve the wider architectural lighting community. Its evolution will be driven by the practical needs of active designers, prioritizing reliability, speed (Flash-level performance), and precision.
